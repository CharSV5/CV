## Charlene Bastians

I am a software developer trained at Makers Academy with 5 months commercial experience at a consultancy Transform (now Engine Transformation). During my time at Makers I developed a good understanding of how to build full stack apps using mainly Ruby and Javascript, but Makers teach you to be language agnostic.

At Transform, I started off with training exercises focused on React and Redux, after several weeks of that, I moved onto a prject for Holland and Barrett. The project was to build H&B a Progressive Web App using Mobify's SDK. I worked closely with all members of the team, some from Transform, others from H&B, to eventually undertake stories on my own. We did two week sprints which culminated in group retros and demonstrations for the stakeholders. Every morning I took part in the Stand Up and communicated with my colleagues and the client about my progress the day before and my plans for the upcoming day. These Agile practices confounded what was taught to me at Makers. I became familiar with React and Redux in particular, as these were the main tools used. I also got lots of practice with git workflow and was introduced to tools like Tig. We used Circle CI for continous integration. 

During my 18 years of work, I had always dreamed of working in the field of science and technology. For a long time I felt that this was never going to happen, until I discovered coding. I began coding in my spare time and very quickly realised that this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I thoroughly enjoy programming as it lets me be both creative and analytical, and I love how empowering it feels to build something from scratch. I joined Makers as I am committed to making this field my life. I've become curious about computer science in general and am eager to learn more about the different roles involed in creating software and ensuring it is safe and robust. 

I am looking for a company with a good attitude towards diversity and culture to guide me on my journey as a junior. I am willing to work across a range of different areas and open to new adventures. Whatever the task, if I'm surrounded by supportive poeple, I'm certain I can do it.

## Other Skills
Having undertaken Photography and Photo Editing courses online, I am quite fascinated with the aesthetics of an app. I can often be found around the world somewhere with my SLR.
I also studied Screenwriting for a couple of years and was involved in some amateur projects. I try to use my creativity in designing my apps and problem solving.

## Experience

I was previously working as a private maternity nurse worldwide. Part of this work was being self reliant, organised, staying up to date with the latest health and safety guidelines and a lot of reflection on how to improve on my daily performance. I had to undertake frequent courses, some of which I did at home so am accustomed to self learning.

I have also worked in the travel industry, both as a travel agent and also as a flight attendant. My love of travel made these excellent roles for me and made me quite familiar with the travel industry.

I have 18 years worth of work experience in total, all of which has been customer/client focused in some way. This has made me aware of how to cultivate a healthy relationship with clients and manage expectations.

I have worked in every type of office and bring with me a wealth of work-place experience.
