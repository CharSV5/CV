## Charlene Bastians

I am a software developer trained at Makers Academy. During my time at Makers I developed a good understanding of how to build full stack apps using mainly Ruby and Javascript, but Makers teach you to be language agnostic.

During my 18 years of work, I had always dreamed of working in the field of science and technology. For a long time I felt that this was never going to happen, until I discovered coding. I began coding in my spare time and very quickly realised that this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I thoroughly enjoy programming as it lets me be both creative and analytical, and I love how empowering it feels to build something from scratch. I joined Makers as I am committed to making this field my life.

I am looking for a company with a good attitude towards diversity and culture to guide me on my journey as a Junior Developer. I am willing to work as Front End, Back End or Full Stack Developer. Whatever the task, if I'm surrounded by supportive poeple, I'm certain I can do it.

## Other Skills
Having undertaken Photography and Photo Editing courses online, I am quite fascinated with the aesthetics of an app. I can often be found around the world somewhere with my SLR.
I also studied Screenwriting for a couple of years and was involved in some amateur projects. I try to use my creativity in designing my apps and problem solving.

## Experience

I was previously working as a private maternity nurse worldwide. Part of this work was being self reliant, organised, staying up to date with the latest health and safety guidelines and a lot of reflection on how to improve on my daily performance. I had to undertake frequent courses, some of which I did at home so am accustomed to self learning.

I have also worked in the travel industry, both as a travel agent and also as a flight attendant. My love of travel made these excellent roles for me and made me quite familiar with the travel industry.

I have 18 years worth of work experience in total, all of which has been customer/client focused in some way. This has made me aware of how to cultivate a healthy relationship with clients and manage expectations.

I have worked in every type of office and bring with me a wealth of work-place experience.
