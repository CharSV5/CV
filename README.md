## Charlene Bastians

I am a software developer trained at Makers Academy. During my time at Makers I developed a good understanding of how to build full stack apps using Ruby and Javascript. I thoroughly enjoy programming as it lets me be both creative and analytical. I am looking for a company with a good attitude towards diversity and culture to guide me on my journey as a Junior Developer. I am willing to take on any language as I was taught to be language agnostic, I am also willing to work as Front End, Back End or Full Stack Developer.

## Other Skills
Having undertaken Photography and Photo Editing courses online, I am quite fascinated with the aesthetics of an app. I can often be found around the world somewhere with my SLR.
I also studied Screenwriting for a couple of years and was involved in some amateur projects. I try to use my creativity in designing my apps and problem solving.

## Experience

I was previously working as a private maternity nurse worldwide. Part of this work was being self reliant, organised, staying up to date with the latest health and safety guidelines and a lot of reflection on how to improve on my daily performance. I had to undertake frequent courses, some of which I did at home so am accustomed to self learning.

I have also worked in the travel industry, both as a travel agent and also as a flight attendant. My love of travel made these excellent roles for me and made me quite familiar with the travel industry.


## Interests

Science, technology, music, live concerts, travel, writing, cinema, motorsport, Science Fiction, Photography and photo editing.
