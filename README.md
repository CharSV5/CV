## Experience

I was previously working as a private maternity nurse worldwide. Part of this work was being self reliant, organised, staying up to date with the latest health and safety guidelines and a lot of reflection on how to improve on my daily performance.

I have also worked in the travel industry, both as a travel agent and also as a flight attendant. My love of travel made these excellent roles for me and made me quite familiar with the travel industry. 


## Interests

Science, technology, motorsport, Science Fiction, Photography and photo editing.
